# =============== DEFENCES CONFIG =============== #

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS!!!!
config-version: 1

# Defences are one of the key features of SkyFactions.
# It allows players and Factions to defend their islands in different ways.

# This is the configuration for limits surrounding defences.
limits:
  # How many threads can be devoted to running defences.
  thread-limit: 2

  # Maximum amount of defences a player island can have.
  max-player-defences: 10
  # Maximum amount of defences a faction island can have.
  max-faction-defences: 20

  # Allow placement of defences in worlds other than the configured island and faction worlds.
  allow-placements-in-other-worlds: false
  # Assuming the above boolean is true, what worlds is this allowed in?
  allowed-worlds: [ ]

# This is the global configuration for all defences.
# This will apply to all defences (unless they override it in per-defence configs), combined with the per-defence config.
global:
  # Global configuration for entities.

    entity-list: [ "" ]

# This allows you to control what Faction rank (exclusively factions) can control which parts of a Defence.
# There are five different "ranks":
# - member: Virtually no permissions. Can participate in raids.
# - fighter: A member but with a few more perms. Can manage certain aspects of the defence (see below)!
# - moderator: These have the same perms as fighters, but can kick players.
# - admin: Has the same perms as moderators, but can also ban players, adjust MOTD, etc. Can manage more aspects of the defence.
# - owner: Outright administrative perms. Kick, ban, disband, MOTD, etc.
# These names are just the actual ranks, but not the configured message names of each rank.
# See the FACTION_TITLES config in the language configs at around Line 360.
permissions:

  # Which ranks should be able to purchase defences?
  purchase-defence: ["moderator", "admin", "owner"]

  # Which ranks can place defences?

  # Which ranks should be able to open the defence management menu outright?
  access-defence: ["fighter", "moderator", "admin", "owner"]

  # Which ranks should be able to replenish ammo?
  # Bearing in mind this will use the Faction's runes supply.

  # Which ranks can upgrade the defence?
  # Bear in mind this will use the Faction's runes supply.
  upgrade-defence: ["moderator", "admin", "owner"]

  # Which ranks should be able to remove the defence completely?
  # This does create an audit log entry ^^
