# =============== RUNES CONFIG =============== #

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS!!!!
config-version: 1

# Runes are SkyFaction's 'currency'. It allows you to advance in the game,
# including purchase defences, upgrade islands / factions and more.

# To gain Runes, you can convert blocks into Runes.
# This configuration file allows you to customise the amount of Runes
# that players will get per block / item, as well as override it
# for certain blocks.

# This is the base configuration for runes.
# Unless overriden in the OVERRIDES section, all items & blocks
# will apply to this configuration.
runes:
  for_each: 4 # For every 4 blocks / items input...
  give: 1 # You will get one rune in return.

# General filters to what items / blocks are allowed or not.
filters:
  allow_lore: true # Allow items with custom lore.
  allow_enchants: true # Allow items with enchants.
  allow_oraxen_items: false # Allow the outright selling of Oraxen items. Unless overriden in the OVERRIDES section with their respective ID, the prices will be default.
  allow_itemsadder_items: false # Allows the outright selling of ItemsAdder items. Read the line above.

  materials:
    # If enabled, all items in list will not be convertible. If disabled, only items in list will be convertible.
    # The OVERRIDES entries bypass this.
    is_blacklist: true

# Override the default configuration for certain blocks / items.
# for_each does not apply here.
# Runes given PER ITEM.
# For itemsadder / oraxen compatibility:
# Specify the ID of the item, beginning with the prefix "ITEMSADDER:" or "ORAXEN:"
# E.g. "ITEMSADDER:ITEM_ID: 5" would give 5 runes per itemsadder item (with the id of ITEM_ID).
