# SkyFactionsReborn  
[![](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/SwxXMrFdjp)](https://discord.gg/SwxXMrFdjp)

This plugin elegantly merges features from Skyblock and Factions. Skyblock, even when played on a big network, can get quite lonely. That's why we combined it with Factions and expanded on the gamemode tenfold. This seemed like an obvious synthesis to explore. This plugin has several dependencies, comes with **MANY** features, but everything is laid out intuitively for the server owner.

## Features  

This plugin contains an abundance of smart features, including:
- Advanced raid mechanics, placeholders, and rewards
- Player island and faction island generation; hooks nicely with a world manager like MyWorlds
- Custom unique currency system called "gems" and a provided (optional) resource pack for them
- Much, much more
