# =============== RUNES CONFIG =============== #

# Runes are SkyFaction's 'currency'. It allows you to advance in the game,
# including purchase defences, upgrade islands / factions and more.

# To gain Runes, you can convert blocks into Runes.
# This configuration file allows you to customise the amount of Runes
# that players will get per block / item, as well as override it
# for certain blocks.

# This is the base configuration for runes.
# Unless overriden in the OVERRIDES section, all items & blocks
# will apply to this configuration.
RUNES:
  FOR_EACH: 4 # For every 4 blocks / items input...
  GIVE: 1 # You will get one rune in return.

# General filters to what items / blocks are allowed or not.
FILTERS:
  ALLOW_LORE: true # Allow items with custom lore.
  ALLOW_ENCHANTS: true # Allow items with enchants.
  MATERIALS:
    # If enabled, all items in LIST will not be convertible. If disabled, only items in LIST will be convertible.
    # The OVERRIDES entries bypass this.
    IS_BLACKLIST: true
