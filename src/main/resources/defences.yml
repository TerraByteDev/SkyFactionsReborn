# =============== DEFENCES CONFIG =============== #

# Defences are one of the key features of SkyFactions.
# It allows players and Factions to defend their islands in different ways.

# This is the configuration for limits surrounding defences.
Limits:
  # Maximum amount of defences a player island can have.
  MAX_PLAYER_DEFENCES: 10
  # Maximum amount of defences a faction island can have.
  MAX_FACTION_DEFENCES: 20

  # Allow placement of defences in worlds other than the configured island and faction worlds.
  ALLOW_PLACEMENTS_IN_OTHER_WORLDS: false
  # Assuming the above boolean is true, what worlds is this allowed in?
  ALLOWED_WORLDS: [ ]

# This is the global configuration for all defences.
# This will apply to all defences (unless they override it in per-defence configs), combined with the per-defence config.
Global:
  # Global configuration for entities.
  ENTITIES:
    # You can edit what entities are deemed as "passive".
