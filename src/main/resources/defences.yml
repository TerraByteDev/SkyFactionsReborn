# =============== DEFENCES CONFIG =============== #

# Defences are one of the key features of SkyFactions.
# It allows players and Factions to defend their islands in different ways.

# This is the configuration for limits surrounding defences.
Limits:
  # Maximum amount of defences a player island can have.
  MAX_PLAYER_DEFENCES: 10

  # Maximum amount of defences a faction island can have.
  MAX_FACTION_DEFENCES: 20

# This is the global configuration for all defences.
# This will apply to all defences (unless they override it in per-defence configs), combined with the per-defence config.
Global:
  # Global configuration for entities.
  ENTITIES:
    # Whether the ENTITY_LIST is a whitelist of entities that can be targeted.
    # Setting this to true will override the above booleans and you would have to add in the entities yourself.
    WHITELIST: false
    # What entities should be blacklisted or whitelisted?
    # See https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
