# This allows you to customise the shape of the GUI.
# You can only have a maximum of 54 slots (9 x 6).
# Each character represents an item / slot.
# '.' represents an empty slot.
# Any other characters are shown below under ITEMS
# Each character corresponds to an item.

# This GUI allows players to view their outgoing join request.
# The Accept (a) and Deny (d) buttons will only appear if the join request had been accepted,
# therefore the player can choose to proceed and join the faction, or deny.
